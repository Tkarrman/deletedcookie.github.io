    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-26</p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile game
      <strong>DeletedCookie</strong> (the “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not require users to create accounts and we do not collect personally identifiable information such as names,
      email addresses, phone numbers, or precise location data.
    </p>
    <p>The App uses third-party services (such as advertising and analytics providers) that may collect certain data automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device or other identifiers</strong> (such as Advertising ID and IP address)</li>
      <li><strong>App activity data</strong> (such as interactions with the app, gameplay events, and ad interactions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising and marketing</strong> – to display ads and measure ad performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong> – to understand how the App is used and to improve gameplay and stability.</li>
      <li><strong>App functionality</strong> – to ensure the App functions correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Some data may be shared with third-party service providers, such as advertising and analytics partners, in order to
      provide their services. These third parties process data in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Examples of third-party services may include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unity Ads / LevelPlay (advertising)</li>
      <li>Other analytics services you enable (if any)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Data transmitted by the App is encrypted in transit using secure network connections (such as HTTPS).</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We do not maintain user accounts and do not store personally identifiable user data on our own servers. For this
      reason, we do not provide a direct method for users to request data deletion. Any data collected by third-party
      services is handled according to their respective privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
