Privacy Policy

Last updated: [ADD DATE]

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile game (the “App”).

Information We Collect

We do not require users to create accounts and we do not collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or precise location data.

However, the App uses third-party services (such as advertising and analytics providers) that may collect certain data automatically, including:

Device or other identifiers
(such as Advertising ID and IP address)

App activity data
(such as interactions with the app, gameplay events, and ad interactions)

How We Use the Data

The data collected is used for the following purposes:

Advertising and marketing
To display ads and measure ad performance.

Analytics
To understand how the App is used and to improve gameplay and stability.

App functionality
To ensure the App functions correctly.

Data Sharing

Some data may be shared with third-party service providers, such as advertising and analytics partners, in order to provide their services. These third parties process data in accordance with their own privacy policies.

Data Security

Data transmitted by the App is encrypted in transit using secure network connections (such as HTTPS).

Data Retention and Deletion

We do not maintain user accounts and do not store personally identifiable user data on our own servers.
For this reason, we do not provide a direct method for users to request data deletion. Any data collected by third-party services is handled according to their respective privacy policies.

Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
